# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project predicts **house prices** based on multiple features such as area, bedrooms, bathrooms, location, condition, and more using **Machine Learning Regression models**.

It includes:

* Data analysis (EDA)
* Feature preprocessing
* Baseline and advanced models
* Model evaluation
* Model saving
* Interactive Command Line Interface (CLI) for predictions

The goal is to build an **end-user friendly system** where anyone can enter house details and get a predicted price.

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 📈 Model Training

Model training is performed inside the Kaggle notebook:

```
notebooks/training_notebook.ipynb
```

This notebook includes:

* Data loading
* EDA
* Feature engineering
* Model training
* Evaluation
* Saving model

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation

We evaluate the models using:

* MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
* RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

Example output:

```json
{
  "LinearRegression": {
    "MAE": 185000,
    "RMSE": 245000
  },
  "RandomForest": {
    "MAE": 92000,
    "RMSE": 135000
  }
}
```

Saved in:

```
outputs/metrics.json
```

---

## 📌 Feature Importance

Random Forest feature importance is visualized and saved as:

```
outputs/feature_importance.png
```

This helps understand which features affect house price most.

---

## 💻 CLI Prediction Tool

An interactive command-line tool is provided for end users.

### Run the CLI Tool

```bash
python predict_house_price_cli.py
```

### Example Usage

```
🏠 House Price Prediction CLI

Enter Area in square feet (e.g., 2500): 2500
Enter Number of Bedrooms (e.g., 3): 3
Enter Number of Bathrooms (e.g., 2): 2
Enter Number of Floors (e.g., 2): 2
Enter Year Built (e.g., 2015): 2015
Enter Location (Urban, Suburban, Downtown, Rural): Urban
Enter Condition (Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor): Good
Enter Garage (Yes/No): Yes
```

### Output

```
Predicted House Price: $345,000
Estimated Price Range: $310,500 - $379,500
```

---

## 📦 Saved Model

The trained model pipeline is saved using Joblib:

```
models/house_price_model.pkl
```

This file is used by the CLI tool for predictions.
