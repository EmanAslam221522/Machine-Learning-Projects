# 🏥 Insurance Premium Prediction (Regression Project)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project builds a **machine learning regression system** to predict **insurance premiums** based on customer information such as age, BMI, smoking status, region, and number of dependents.

The main goal is not only to predict premiums accurately, but also to **analyze model performance across different customer segments** (age groups and BMI categories) to ensure fairness and reliability.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Predict insurance premiums using regression models
* Engineer meaningful features such as **age bands** and **BMI bands**
* Compare a **baseline model** with a **boosting model**
* Perform **segment-wise error analysis**
* Report **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** for different customer groups

## 📂 Dataset Description

A synthetic insurance-style dataset is used with the following features:

### Input Features

| Feature      | Description                          |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `age`        | Age of the customer                  |
| `BMI`        | Body Mass Index                      |
| `smoker`     | Whether the customer smokes (Yes/No) |
| `dependents` | Number of dependents                 |
| `region`     | Residential region                   |
| `age_band`   | Age category (engineered)            |
| `bmi_band`   | BMI category (engineered)            |

### Target Variable

| Feature             | Description                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `insurance_premium` | Insurance cost to be predicted |

## 🛠 Feature Engineering

### 1️⃣ Age Bands

Customers are grouped into age categories:

* 18–25
* 26–35
* 36–45
* 46–55
* 56–65

This helps the model learn age-related pricing patterns.

---

### 2️⃣ BMI Bands

BMI values are categorized into:

* Underweight
* Normal
* Overweight
* Obese

This captures health-risk related cost differences.

---

## ⚙️ Data Preprocessing

* One-Hot Encoding applied to categorical features:

  * `smoker`
  * `region`
  * `age_band`
  * `bmi_band`
* Dataset split into **training** and **testing** sets
* Target variable separated before training

---

## 🤖 Models Used

### 🔹 Baseline Model

**Linear Regression**

* Simple and interpretable
* Used as a benchmark

### 🔹 Advanced Model

**Gradient Boosting Regressor**

* Ensemble learning method
* Captures non-linear relationships
* Provides better accuracy

---

## 📏 Evaluation Metric

### Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

MAE measures the **average absolute difference** between predicted and actual premiums.

[
MAE = \frac{1}{n} \sum |y_{true} - y_{pred}|
]

Lower MAE means better performance.

---

## 📊 Segment-Wise Error Analysis

To check model fairness and consistency, MAE is calculated for different customer segments.

---

### 🔹 MAE by Age Band

| Age Band | MAE   |
| -------- | ----- |
| 18–25    | 82.72 |
| 26–35    | 91.26 |
| 36–45    | 82.52 |
| 46–55    | 92.65 |
| 56–65    | 99.16 |

**Observation:**

* Model performs best for young and middle-aged customers
* Higher error for older customers (56–65)

---

### 🔹 MAE by BMI Band

| BMI Band    | MAE   |
| ----------- | ----- |
| Underweight | 89.52 |
| Normal      | 99.27 |
| Overweight  | 89.71 |
| Obese       | 79.12 |

**Observation:**

* Best performance for obese customers
* Normal BMI group shows higher prediction error

---
